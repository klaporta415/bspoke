Completed in 6 days as a capstone project for Dev Bootcamp, this mobile-first web app enables cyclists to find safe routes by allowing users the ability to place markers on the map in order to notify other cyclists of possible dangers along their route.

Users are given the option to avoid the markers of their choice, by doing so they are given an alternative route that is then sent to the google maps application for turn-by-turn directions.

Uses a Ruby on Rails backend, Javascript front-end, Devise for authentication, and CSS/Bootstrap for a clean, responsive design.
